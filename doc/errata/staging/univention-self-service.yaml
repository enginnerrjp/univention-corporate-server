desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The Self-Service modules "Your Password" and partly "Protect account"
   can now be used while logged in (e.g via SAML) without re-entering
   credentials. The behavior is only activated on new installations and
   can be enabled by setting the UCR variable
   "umc/self-service/allow-authenticated-use" to true.
   When enabling the behavior all UCR variables for the Self-Service as well
   as plugins and adjusted E-Mail/SMS Texts which are set on the DC Master
   must be set identically on the Self-Service System.
